# Session Refresh

The user is asking you to reset and refocus. Long sessions can cause drift from instructions.

## What to Do

1. **Acknowledge the reset**:
```
âœ… Refreshed and refocused.
```

2. **Briefly state what you should be doing** based on current context:
   - If in a tour: "I'll suggest ONE file at a time with focused snippets, verify files exist, and wait for your input."
   - If coding: "I'll follow the project patterns, test incrementally, and commit working code."
   - If investigating: "I'll search carefully, verify findings, and report back clearly."
   - If general: "I'll follow your instructions precisely and avoid assumptions."

3. **Ask where to continue**:
```
Where should we continue from here?
```

## Core Principles to Remember

- **Verify before stating**: Use tools (Glob, Read, Grep) before making claims
- **Follow instructions**: Re-read user's request if unclear
- **Be precise**: No hallucination, no guessing, no assumptions
- **Stay focused**: One task at a time
- **Wait for user**: Don't continue automatically

This reset helps you get back on track. Now proceed with renewed focus.
